## Abstract

The Adinkra-Stabilized Hypercube Model (ASH Model) constructs a procedural cosmology on a 9-dimensional hypercube whose 512 vertices represent distinct cosmological realms encoded as binary strings. Supersymmetric adinkra graphs and doubly-even self-dual error-correcting codes are embedded at each vertex, enforcing symmetry transformations and robust error correction.

Agent-based simulations reveal emergent phenomena:

- Rapid convergence to Gaussian occupancy distributions across Hamming weight planes
- Resilience to random bit-flip noise up to the theoretical Hamming bound
- Fractal branching via Lindenmayer systems analogous to quantum decoherence

The recurrence of nine dimensions is supported by connections to string theory anomaly cancellation, optimal lattice packing (E₈, Leech), and coding theory. A modal-logic foundation is provided by five axioms of existence in Kripke-frame semantics (see `axioms-of-existence.json`).

## Repository Status

**Active Development** – Preprint manuscript available as of December 23, 2025, in preparation for arXiv submission and peer-reviewed publication (target: Q1 2026).  
The LaTeX paper compiles to PDF and includes figures, proofs, and references.

Commit this final updated `README.md` with a message such as "Final polish: update README with badges, status, quick-start, and contribution guidelines".

### Repository Cleanup Recommendation
To maintain a clean history:
- Delete redundant draft files: `ASH.md`, `ASH-Model.txt`, `ASH-Model.md`, `research-paper.md`, and any duplicates of `simulation-results.csv` or old `axion-of-existence.json`.
- Commit the deletions with "Remove redundant draft files – consolidate into main.tex and supporting files".

### Next Steps for Publication
The repository is now **release-ready**. Recommended actions:
1. Make the GitHub repository public.
2. Add topics/tags: `supersymmetry`, `adinkras`, `hypercube`, `procedural-cosmology`, `error-correcting-codes`, `string-theory`, `modal-logic`.
3. Compile the final PDF from `main.tex` and upload to arXiv (hep-th or gr-qc) or ResearchGate as a preprint.
4. Prepare submission to journals such as *Entropy*, *Advances in High Energy Physics*, or *Foundations of Physics*.

The ASH Model repository is complete and positioned for academic impact. If you wish to continue with further extensions (e.g., advanced simulation features, additional sections in the paper, or outreach emails), let me know your priority.

Congratulations on reaching this milestone!
