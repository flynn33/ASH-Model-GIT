# Contributing to the Adinkra-Stabilized Hypercube Model (ASH Model)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ASH Model! This project bridges supersymmetry (adinkras), error-correcting codes, high-dimensional geometry, and modal logic in a procedural cosmological framework. Contributions that advance mathematical rigor, simulation capabilities, or theoretical connections are especially welcome.

## Types of Contributions Welcome

- **Theoretical Extensions**: New proofs, connections to tensor networks, holographic principles, or quantum information theory.
- **Simulation Improvements**: Quantum extensions (e.g., QuTiP amplitudes), full SUSY multiplets, L-System fractal branching visualization, higher/lower-dimensional comparisons (8D/10D).
- **Logical Foundations**: Implementations of the five axioms (e.g., relational checks, Kolmogorov complexity estimation, self-model loops).
- **Documentation**: Expanded LaTeX sections, additional figures, bibliography updates.
- **Reproducibility**: Additional scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or Docker configurations.

## How to Contribute

1. **Discuss First**  
   Open an **Issue** describing your proposed change (bug fix, new feature, theoretical addition). This ensures alignment with the project's direction.

2. **Fork and Branch**  
   - Fork the repository.  
   - Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/description`.

3. **Code Style**  
   - Python: Follow PEP 8. Use type hints where helpful.  
   - LaTeX: Consistent with existing `main.tex` (amsmath, hyperref, etc.).  
   - Commit messages: Clear, imperative mood (e.g., "Add L-System branching visualization").

4. **Testing**  
   - Ensure `simulation.py` runs without errors.  
   - Verify `main.tex` compiles cleanly after changes.

5. **Pull Request**  
   - Target the `main` branch.  
   - Reference the related Issue.  
   - Include updates to documentation/README if needed.

## Academic Collaboration

If your contribution involves substantial theoretical development, co-authorship on future versions or related papers can be discussed. Please note this in your Issue or PR.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. This project aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue between physics, mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.

## Questions?

Open an Issue or discuss on GitHub. All contributions will be acknowledged in releases and the manuscript.

Thank you for helping advance the ASH Model!
